# Problems of Collaborative Software development

Merging can be a difficult moment 
in the life cycle of a software.

Git will try to do *reasonable* operations
when merging two different lines of work,
but:
- There might be an detectable ambiguity in the way that
  two different lines of work can be reconciled
  (this leads to a conflict)
- the results are not guaranteed 
  to give you working software all the times
  (i.e., you don't get a conflict,
  but the result is not correct either
  - *this is scarier*).

While there are tools that can help,
presenting the changes and the conflicts 
in some convenient way,
the collaboration practices are 
what really make a difference.

In the rest of this lesson we will focus 
on tools for 

Continuous integration practices,
including automated checks 
like testing and linting,
can also greatly reduce 
the effort needed for merging contributions.
